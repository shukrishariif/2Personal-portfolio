## Challenges Faced and Solutions
During the development of my portfolio, I encountered a few challenges. Here are some of them and how I overcame them:

1. *Challenge 1*: Responsive design across different devices.
   - *Solution*: I used CSS media queries and responsive design techniques to ensure that the portfolio website looks and functions well on different screen sizes.

2. *Challenge 2*: Optimizing performance and load times.
   - *Solution*: I implemented code splitting techniques and lazy loading for components and images to optimize the performance and reduce initial load times.

3. *Challenge 3*: Integrating external libraries and APIs.
   - *Solution*: I carefully followed the documentation of the libraries and APIs I wanted to use and integrated them into my project following the provided guidelines and examples.
